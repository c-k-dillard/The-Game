# The Game

## Description

The Game is not a game, but a way to figure out what to do between multiple people in a group. The Game allows people to make a list of activities and vote on most-preferred one, each allowing for scores ranging from 1-10 (least desirable to most desirable). The activities are then ranked by their point values and displayed. The highest-scoring activity is chosen as what the group should do.
